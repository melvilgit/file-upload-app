# file-upload-app
##file-upload-app written in python
This is a python flask app which can upload /download and delete files .
    All the file uploaded will be stored in  the disk with filename and file md5 hash stored in sqlite DB.
    If a different file with same content is uploaded again , then then existing file content will be reused 
    by mapping then the new filename to old md5 in sqlite .
    
    File Name     |  Md5sum
    ------------- | -------------
     File X       |  *abc123*1
     File Y       |  xyz456
     File Z       |  *abc123*
     
     Here , File X and File Z shave the same content , Hence Assuming File Z is 
     the latter insertion ,only File X will be  stored in the DISK .
     If we have to retrieve File Z ,which is not in disk , We query the sqliteDB 
     for the md5 of File Z, Again queries the db  with that md5 to retrived File X .
     Then sends File X by just changing the name.
